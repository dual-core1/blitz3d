The Quest to Upgrade Blitz3D

Background:

Blitz3D is an old-school computer game programming language and IDE made by Blitz Research. Many programmers like myself got started in game development using this product. With a syntax inherited from BASIC, it makes 3D graphics programming a breeze. However, the problem with Blitz3D is... it's really, really old. And games made with it don't run very well on modern systems (unless run in windowed mode), most likely due to its massively outdated version of DirectX. But I felt that Blitz3D shouldn't be left to die. So I set out to upgrade it.

The Plan:

I want to update Blitz3D to at least DirectX 9 (and eventually DX11/12) and make any other changes that will get games made with it to run well on modern computers. I also hope to add some new features when the main upgrades are finished. It won't be easy, but I hope it will be fun.

What's Finished:

Compiled Blitz3D from source (much harder than it sounds).

What's Being Done:

Documenting the program before I begin upgrading it
